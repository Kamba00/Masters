Myosin is the prototype of a molecular motorâ€”a protein that converts chemical ener-
gy in the form of ATP(Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is the source of energy for use and storage at the cellular level. The struc-
ture of ATP is a nucleoside triphosphate, consisting of a nitrogenous base (adenine), a ribose sugar, and three serially bon-
ded) to mechanical energy, thus generating force and movement.
Hydrolysis - ATP +H2O = ADP + Pi + Energy
