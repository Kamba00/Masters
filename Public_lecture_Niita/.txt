Modelling and computer simulation - Modelling the spread of infectious diseases.
Motility
Consider subjects as something simpler

SIR Model assumptions
1. infection may occur when S&I coexist
2. No spontanaety
3. No multiplications

Limitations:
Age groups are not considered
Migrations are not considered
Loss of immunity is not considered

Plotted against time step
computers cannot calculate derivatives
Runge kutta method-simplicity

scheme:
-set goal on what you want to predict
-observe phenomena you want to simulate
-make a Model("abstract out all irrelevant details)
-make simulation codes and run it
-Compare simulation  and the actual phenomena
-If agreement is not satisfactory go back to #3
